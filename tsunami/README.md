Tsunami simulation, following [Milan Cucic: Modern Fortran. Building efficient parallel applications](https://www.manning.com/books/modern-fortran).

## Compile and run

```
$ make
$ ./tsunami
```

`make` enables several compiler options for debugging. Use `make build` for optimized compilation.

## TODO

* make `integer` and `real` kinds explicit and document which data ranges the grid etc. can take
